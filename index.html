<p>I live in North Wales with my wife <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/gemmabradbury">Gemma</a> and my dog, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gemmabradbury/sets/72157617508065557/">Mr Jones</a>.</p>

<p>Professionally I'm a developer, during the day working at <a href="http://www.viewcreative.co.uk">View Creative</a> in Conwy, but I do take freelance work if its interesting. I have a degree in Mathematics and could happily spend days talking to myself on some of the nuances of emergent behaviors in complex systems.</p>
	
<p>Over time I hope to fill this bit up a bit, with interesting things, but for now, its remarkably sparse, and I make no excuses for that.</p>
