My "employer":http://viewcreative.co.uk has recently been hiring. We were looking for a junior developer, someone who's not baby-faced-fresh to the whole development thing, but not putting too much emphasis on prior experience. Someone who wants to learn, and can pick new things up. 

As a really quick way to gauge any candidates I asked the following questions :

<blockquote>
	<p>What text editor do you use?</p>
	<p>What languages do you use?</p>
	<p>Tell me something interesting (_anything_).</p>
</blockquote>

I didn't really care too much about the answer. It's the delivery of the answer that's important. 

If you answer in single words, broken sentences or just seem disinterested I'm done right there. If you answer quickly, talk fast, gesture wildly, you've got my attention. I'm not a recruiter, a manager, or anyone from HR. I'm your peer. Let's have a discussion. 

I don't want to work with boring people, and I'm sure you don't either. I want to be able to get lost in the intricacies of a problem, I want back and forth, above all I want a lively discussion.
