h1. {{ page.title }}

By way of an impromptu interlude I propose two points of discussion.

h2. Pump or Trump?

Which is the least offensive way of refering to a gaseous emission? 

Initially I would of said _pump_. It's rounder, less agressive and more open to other interpretations. But that's only the first case. Consider _trump_. It's a school yard phrase, and is generally more likely to be used when refering to said *gaseous emission*. Weighing it up:

|_. Pump |_. Trump |
| Rounder | Harder |
| Ambiguous | Agressive |
| Office | School Yard |

Where does that leave us? Well, these things are never cut and dry. Given the choice I would say it would break down to 40% pump, 60% trump, at least for my use cases. Or more succinctly :

h2. How many things would make more sense, presented as in graph form?

That's right. 

All of it.
