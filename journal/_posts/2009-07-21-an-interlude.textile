h1. {{ page.title }}

By way of an impromptu interlude I propose two points of discussion.

h2. Pump or Trump?

Which is the least offensive way of referring to a gaseous emission? 

Initially I would of said _pump_. It's rounder, less aggressive and more open to other interpretations. But that's only the first case. Consider _trump_. It's a school yard phrase, and is generally more likely to be used when referring to said *gaseous emission*. Weighing it up:

|_. Pump |_. Trump |
| Rounder | Harder |
| Ambiguous | Aggressive |
| Office | School Yard |

Where does that leave us? Well, these things are never cut and dry. Given the choice I would say it would break down to 40% pump, 60% trump, at least for my use cases, but location and company are also factors. To sum it up succinctly :

This conveniently brings us to the second point - 

h2. What Things That Would be Better in Presented Graph Form?

That's right. 

Everything.
