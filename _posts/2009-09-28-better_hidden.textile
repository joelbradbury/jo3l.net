h1. {{ page.title }}

We've been through "Expression Engine's":http://expressionengine.com mechanism for "handling hidden templates":/journal/2009/09/hidden-templates/. Basically it boils down to prepending the templates you want hidden with a period. 

That works ok, but cause conflicts with other things, notably TextMate, and to a lesser degree Finder. There are "workarounds for solving":/journal/2009/09/textmate-hidden-templates/ the issues in TextMate, but it's not too pretty.

h2. I Don't Like the Look of Them

Come on. Periods at the start of every hidden file are just unpleasant. That single factor was the primary reason I hadn't done anything with hidden EE templates until recently. Of course if I'd of known - 

h2. Hidden Templates Can be Prepended with the Character of your choice

I would of jumped on the band wagon ages ago. 

Heading over to your trusty EE's *config.php* simply set the conf variable *hidden_template_indicator* to your choosing. In my case : 

{% highlight php %}
$conf['hidden_template_indicator'] = '_';
{% endhighlight %}

As by previous convention I use underscores as separators already. 

By having a non *period* character as your hidden template indicator you neatly sidestep all the issues with hidden files and TextMate/Finder.
