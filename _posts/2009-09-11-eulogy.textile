Old Polo, you've served me well.

We've been so many places together, and you were the one that took me there. 

Maybe more recently you've been showing your age. You've been getting noisy, and rough around the edges. The youthful power you once had has fleeted, gone never to come back.

Still, we had fun together. You were the first car I ever bought, the first one I ever had proper, proud ownership of. Yes you were white, yes, you showed the dirt, and yes, I didn't clean you as often as I should, but when you were clean, you shone.

I feel quite sad leaving you now, knowing that I'll likely be the last person to ever drive you, knowing that you're off to the great scrapyard in the sky.

Farewell old Polo. I still have the passenger side door lock that pulled out 12 months ago, that I've been meaning to fix. I guess I never will now.
