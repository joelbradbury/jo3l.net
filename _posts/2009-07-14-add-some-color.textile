h1. {{ page.title }}

Everybody knows that using svn/git* over command line is the way forward. GUI's make for a soft developer (I'm looking at you "tortoiseSVN":http://tigris.svn.org) and leaves you in a bind on different systems where they aren't supported (ie. over ssh). 

One of the things that helps massively is adding some color. Git has this ability _out the box_, you just need to enable it. 

h2. Color in Git

Git has supported the '--color' option for a while for the *diff* and *log* commands, but since version 1.5, you can add color system wide for git. All you need to do is edit the .git/config file and add the following.

{% highlight ini%}
[color]
  branch = auto
  diff = auto
  status = auto
[color "branch"]
  current = yellow reverse
  local = yellow 
  remote = green
[color "diff"]
  meta = yellow bold
  frag = magenta bold
  old = red bold
  new = green bold
[color "status"]
  added = yellow
  changed = green
  untracked = cyan
{% endhighlight %}

Bang. Color in your git commands. Pretty. Now if only we could do something similar with SVN.
