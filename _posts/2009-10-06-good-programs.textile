<blockquote><p class="first">Good programs do not contain spelling errors or have grammatical mistakes</p>
<p class="second">This is probably a result of fractal attention to detail</p>
<p class="third">in great programs things are correct at all levels,</p>
<p class="fourth">down to the periods at the ends of sentences in comments.</p>
