h1. {{ page.title }}

In "Expression Engine":http://expressionengine.com, sometimes you don't want a template accessible to anyone that could stumble across a url. Most likely you'll be using these templates as embedded fragments to make up the common parts of a page.

They're incomplete HTML, that make sense when part of the whole, but you really don't want to be visible on their own. In "EE":http://expressionengine.com you can use *hidden templates* to solve this. By making a template hidden it will still be available to embed the standard way, but can't be accessed via the _template_group/template_name_ url. 

So in our case our template *head* (which has all the html header in) previously would have been embedded such :

<blockquote>
{embed="includes/head"}

_but would have also been accessible via_

http://site_url/includes/head
</blockquote>

So now, we rename it to *.head* and change our embed to :

<blockquote>
{embed="includes/.head"}
</blockquote>

Now a visit to _http://site_url/includes/.head_ gives us a 404, and all is good in the world.
