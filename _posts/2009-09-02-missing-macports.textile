h1. sudo port : command not found

Seriously - what's up with that? I know macports is installed, I used it just the other day. 

To fix it three quick lines that re-add the paths to your .bash_profile

{% highlight bash %}
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin
export MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/local/share/man
export INFOPATH=$INFOPATH:/opt/local/share/info
{% endhighlight %}

That will stick the right paths in the right places, and we're back on track. Run a *sudo port -d selfupdate* just to be sure and move on with your life.
