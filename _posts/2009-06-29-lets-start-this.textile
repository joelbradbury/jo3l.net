I've never been properly happy with the 'me' thats online. Well, that's an overstatement. I don't actually think there's ever been a proper 'me' online. Just a random collection of blog articles and posts. 

So I'm aiming to change that. I've realized that I need somewhere to write, and somewhere to experiment with things that isn't totally private. From here on in, I'm going to try and actually write and do things _online_. I'm not promising they'll be interesting or profound. But hopefully they will be semi-regular. 

In the spirit of _release early_, _release often_, I'm throwing this out there with very little fanciness. There are no javascript interactions, the page styles are remarkably paired down and the underlying technology is..., well interesting. But that's the way I like it, at least for now. As with anything, the hardest part is actually starting.
