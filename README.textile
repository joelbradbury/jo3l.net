h1. This is the underlying data for my blog

Using "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll it gets turned into a static site, when after a push up to github

It's all just a way of getting closer to the content without loosing the flexibility. I don't need some fancy control panel to tell me how to markup my posts, and I defiantly don't need some clever script tidying up my markup.

I don't want to loose my data, by tied to anyone place, or operating system. Once I've written something, it's still mine, and i want the ability to change anything I want, at any time. 

I can't take any of the credit for any of this, it was all made by far more motivated men.

h2. License

You can fork this site at any point. Hell, you can even download the whole thing as a tar, but if you do, the content of the following directories are Copyright Joel Bradbury. If you want to reuse anything in them, ask for my permission first. I'll doubtless say yes, but don't be a dick about it. 

* _posts/
* images.

Everything else is far game, and by far game, I mean MIT licensed. The original setup was forked from http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll so have a look there if you'd like to see further up the tree. Take the html, css and javascript and do whatever you please (though preferably not in exactly the format they are now). If you use them, let me know, or a link back would be just lovely. And you are a lovely person aren't you.
