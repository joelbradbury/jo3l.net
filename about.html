	<p>So what would you like to know about me? I'm a 24 year old developer, and I live in North Wales with my brilliant wife <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/gemmabradbury">Gemma</a>, any my small and rather excitable Jack Russel, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/gemmabradbury">Mr Jones</a>. During the day I work at <a href="http://viewcreative.co.uk">View Creative</a> as a developer, focusing my massive array of php, mysql, javascript and css skills on all forms of websites that happen to cross my path. Outside of the office, I'm far more interesting. But isn't everybody?</p>
